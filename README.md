# 2026 ISRO–ESA Heliophysics Workshop,  Hands-On Materials

This repository contains all notebooks, data-access examples, and analysis workflows for the hands-on component of the Joint ISRO–ESA Heliophysics Workshop on Aditya-L1, Solar Orbiter, and Proba-3 (January 19–23, 2026, Thiruvananthapuram, India).

The goal is to provide a unified, Python-based environment where participants can explore and analyse heliophysics data from multiple missions using SunPy, mission-specific tools, and coordinated multi-instrument workflows.

## Contents

- Instrument tutorials (Mon–Wed):
  Introductory notebooks provided by each instrument team, including data access, basic workflows, and example visualisations for:
    - Solar Orbiter (EUI, STIX, SPICE, PHI, Metis, SoloHI, MAG, SWA, EPD, RPW)
    - Aditya-L1 (SUIT, VELC, HEL1OS, ASPEX, SoLEXS, MAG, PAPA)
    - Proba-3 (ASPIICS)

- Cross-instrument science workflows (Thu–Fri):
  Small, focused analysis pipelines demonstrating how to combine data across missions to study:
    - Solar flares (multi-wavelength & multi-mission)
    - Large & small-scale coronal structures
    - In-situ heliospheric variability (solar wind & energetic particles)

## Common resources
Shared environment files, documentation links, utilities, and template notebooks.
